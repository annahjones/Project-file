# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

This project tracks and analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across various countries and regions. The goal is to clean, process, and analyze real-world data using Python tools, then visualize key trends and communicate insights.

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Compare metrics across countries/regions.
- Visualize trends using line charts, bar charts, and optional choropleth maps.
- Summarize findings and communicate insights through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook or report.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib`: Plotting and visualization.
  - `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization.
## Insights and Reflections
Fastest Vaccine Rollout: The country with the fastest vaccination rollout demonstrated a significant decrease in new cases.
Impact of Healthcare Infrastructure: Countries with stronger healthcare systems managed to control the pandemic more effectively.
Trends Over Time: The global trend showed a decline in cases and deaths following widespread vaccination.
Geographical Anomalies: Some regions exhibited unusual spikes in cases, likely due to underreporting or data inconsistencies.
